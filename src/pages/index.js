    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      The 7DSaaS challenge is a software development jam designed to help you, an <i>entrepreneurially minded full-stack web developer</i>, build a fully-functional MVP for your next SaaS idea in a seven day period.
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      If you're serious about launching a successful SaaS, you should validate your current problem + solution as quickly as possible, so you can either start making a profit or move on to the next product.
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      This challenge is designed to help you do just that.
    </Text>
    <Heading as="h2" sx={{ mt: 4 }}>Why is this a thing?</Heading>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      I was planning for a <Link href="https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2020">week-long game jam</Link>, and realized I'd rather spend the time building a product and working towards financial independence.
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      As developers, the biggest challenge facing us is figuring out how to avoid spending all of our time coding. Software is only 10% of what constitutes a successful SaaS, and the rest lies in finding a good problem, determining product-market fit, sales, and all of the other not-so-fun stuff that we like to pretend doesn't have to happen.
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      But it does have to happen. And I wanted a community to hold me accountable to spending no longer than a week building my MVP, so that after doing the "fun stuff", I could be freed up to focus on what <i>really</i> mattered.
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      So... welcome to 7DSaaS â€“ a jam for building a <strong>profitable software product</strong>.
    </Text>
    <Heading as="h2" sx={{ mt: 4 }}>Who are you, anyway?</Heading>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      Glad you asked! I'm a <Link href="https://elliotbonneville.com/">full-stack software developer and startup consultant</Link> based in Providence, RI. I've launched three non-software-related startups, and now I'm focusing on leveraging my developer skills to build a profitable SaaS.
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      I also run a <Link href="https://meetup.com/react-ri">React meetup in Rhode Island</Link>, where I <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZQUVwy120wwA3hSnRiawiw?view_as=subscriber">speak regularly</Link>.
    </Text>
    <Heading as="h2" sx={{ mt: 4 }}>Do you want money?</Heading>
    <Text variant='body' sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      Heck no. I can't afford to pay for something like this right now â€“ I'm trying to bootstrap a SaaS here! It's only reasonable to expect that's the case for you, too. So, the challenge is completely free to join.
    </Text>
    <Heading as="h2" sx={{ mt: 4 }}>March 8th is too soon. What's the schedule?</Heading>
    <Text variant="body" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      I'm planning a jam every quarter, so if you can't make this jam, the next one is coming up soon â€“ feel free to sign up below to stay updated on that. Besides, even if you can't participate, it's always fun to watch other people work â€“ you might learn something!
    </Text>
    <Heading as="h2" sx={{ mt: 4 }} id="sign-up">Join Us</Heading>
    <Text variant='body' sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      Sign up below to get instant access to our Slack. You'll also get an invite to the mailing list, but don't worry â€“ you can just ignore that (also, I don't send you ðŸ’© emails).
